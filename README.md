# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Prostate-Gland-MRI

The growing use of medical image analysis has given rise to the segmentation of organs,
diseases, and abnormalities within medical images. In recent years, deep neural models
have shown considerable promise for segmenting medical images and helping monitor tu
mor growth and administering medicine. A growing part of magnetic resonance imaging
is image analysis. Semantic segmentation allows regions of interest in an image to be de
scribed, categorize, and visualized. It is possible to segment a large number of images with
an enormous variety using semantic image segmentation. This is done by assigning a class
of objects to every pixel within an image. The prostate gland is segmented from magnetic
resonance images using deep learning techniques using semantic segmentation. Moreover,
Tversky loss functions were analyzed and compared to obtain the highest Dice and F1
scores. Binary Cross Entropy with Logit Loss is used as a baseline loss function. Experi
ments with different Tversky Loss functions are performed by weighting recall and precision
values. Results are compared in terms of accuracy and performance.
